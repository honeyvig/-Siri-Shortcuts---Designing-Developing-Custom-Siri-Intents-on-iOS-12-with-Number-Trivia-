# -Siri-Shortcuts---Designing-Developing-Custom-Siri-Intents-on-iOS-12-with-Number-Trivia
To design and develop Custom Siri Intents for iOS 12 using Siri Shortcuts, you'll need to create a Siri Intent in your app and register that intent so Siri can interact with your app. The example here will focus on creating a Siri Shortcut that responds to a Number Trivia request, where Siri can provide fun facts about numbers.
Steps for Implementing Custom Siri Intents with Number Trivia:

    Set Up SiriKit: Ensure that you are using Xcode to create your iOS project, and enable SiriKit in the app's capabilities.

    Create a Custom Intent: Define your custom intent for Siri to recognize and act upon.

    Handle the Intent in Your App: Implement the intent handling code to provide the trivia for a specific number.

    Add the Shortcut in the App: Provide the functionality for users to add the shortcut to their Siri interface.

Step 1: Set Up Your Xcode Project

    Open Xcode and create a new iOS project.
    Make sure SiriKit is enabled for your app:
        Go to the Signing & Capabilities tab of your project.
        Click on + Capability and choose Siri.

Step 2: Define the Custom Intent

    Create an Intents target in your Xcode project:
        File > New > Target > Intents Extension.
        Give it a name like "NumberTriviaIntent".

    In your Intents Definition File (Intents.intentdefinition), add a new intent. This is where you'll define the custom command Siri will recognize.
        Add an Intent for "Get Number Trivia."
        Add a parameter for the Number (e.g., an integer) for which Siri will provide trivia.
        You can also define the response, like "Here is a fun fact about the number X..."

Step 3: Implement the Intent Handler

In the generated IntentHandler.swift file, implement the logic to handle the GetNumberTriviaIntent.

import Intents

class IntentHandler: INExtension, GetNumberTriviaIntentHandling {

    // Handle the intent when it's triggered by Siri
    func handle(intent: GetNumberTriviaIntent, completion: @escaping (GetNumberTriviaIntentResponse) -> Void) {
        // Get the number from the intent
        guard let number = intent.number else {
            completion(GetNumberTriviaIntentResponse.failure(failureReason: "No number provided"))
            return
        }
        
        // Fetch trivia for the number (you could get this from an API or hardcode it)
        let trivia = fetchTrivia(for: number)
        
        // Return the trivia as a response to Siri
        let response = GetNumberTriviaIntentResponse.success(trivia: trivia)
        completion(response)
    }

    // Fetch trivia about a number (simple example, could be more complex)
    func fetchTrivia(for number: Int) -> String {
        let trivia = [
            1: "1 is the first natural number.",
            2: "2 is the smallest and the only even prime number.",
            3: "3 is the first odd prime number.",
            4: "4 is the only number with the same number of letters in its name as its value.",
            5: "5 is the number of fingers on one hand."
        ]
        
        return trivia[number, default: "I don't have trivia for that number."]
    }
}

Step 4: Add Siri Shortcuts to Your App

To make your app interact with Siri, you need to provide a way for the user to create a shortcut for the custom intent.

In your main app, you can register the NumberTriviaIntent and allow the user to add the shortcut.

import Intents
import IntentsUI

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Register the intent for the shortcut (you can do this at a suitable place in your app)
        let intent = GetNumberTriviaIntent()
        intent.number = 3
        
        let interaction = INInteraction(intent: intent, response: GetNumberTriviaIntentResponse.success(trivia: "3 is the first odd prime number."))
        interaction.donate { (error) in
            if let error = error {
                print("Error donating interaction: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            } else {
                print("Successfully donated interaction.")
            }
        }
    }
}

Step 5: Adding the Shortcut to Siri

You can allow users to add the shortcut directly to Siri by using Siri Shortcuts UI or don’tate interaction through your app.

Here’s how to allow the user to add it manually to Siri:

    You can provide a button or an action in your app to allow the user to add a shortcut for Get Number Trivia.

    Use INUIAddVoiceShortcutViewController to present a UI to the user for adding the shortcut to Siri.

import IntentsUI

// Present the UI to add a voice shortcut for Siri
let intent = GetNumberTriviaIntent()
intent.number = 7  // Set a sample number

let shortcut = INShortcut(intent: intent)

let addVoiceShortcutVC = INUIAddVoiceShortcutViewController(shortcut: shortcut)
addVoiceShortcutVC.delegate = self
present(addVoiceShortcutVC, animated: true, completion: nil)

Step 6: Testing the Siri Shortcut

    Build and Run your app on a real device (Siri does not work on simulators).
    Once the user has added the shortcut to Siri, they can say something like:
        "Hey Siri, give me number trivia about 3."
    Siri will respond with the trivia about the number based on your app's response.

Conclusion

This guide provided an overview of how to design and develop a Custom Siri Intent for Number Trivia using Siri Shortcuts in iOS 12. The key steps included creating the custom intent, implementing the intent handler, registering the shortcut with Siri, and allowing users to add the shortcut through your app interface.

With this basic setup, you can expand the trivia database, refine your user interface, and use advanced features of SiriKit to make your app even more interactive and fun!
